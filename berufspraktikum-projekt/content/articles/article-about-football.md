## First of all. What is Football?

Football is a ball sport in which two teams compete against each other with the aim of scoring more goals than the opponent and thus winning the match. The game is usually played for two periods of 45 minutes, plus injury time and, if necessary, extra time and/or penalty shoot-outs. A team usually consists of eleven players, one of whom is the goalkeeper. The ball may be played with the whole body except the arms and hands; it is mainly kicked with the foot. Only the goalkeeper (inside his own penalty area) - or the field players when taking a throw-in - may touch the ball with their hands.

The success of football is based firstly on its simplicity. The expenditure on resources and equipment is relatively low (see, for example, street football), which has made it very popular in many developing countries, and it is easy for newcomers and spectators to understand or even take for granted. Secondly, comparatively few goals are scored, which increases the value of a goal and makes the games more exciting, since superior or better-placed teams do not win as often or cannot be determined as winners early on as in other ball sports. However, these special features have been counteracted in recent times by more complicated regulations (e.g. changes to the offside rule) and, in top-level football, ever greater (technical) expenditure (e.g. video evidence), which are intended to lead to a "fairer" football.
